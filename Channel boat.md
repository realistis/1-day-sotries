EXT. BOARDING SIDE OF THE FISH BOAT CHANNEL - DAY # 1 #

On a fishing boat with cabin in the middle, boat heavily laden with crates, captain concentrated, nervous, recovering moorings. No sailors.

GEDESPOINA
Hello, I'm Gedespoina, nice to meet you

DARKHAIREDGIRL
Hello

ALEX
Hello, my name is Alex, delighted too

CYNICAL
A hell-o ? What is that ? But "hello" anyway!

GEDESPOINA
The crossing will be fast, barely 4 hours

CYNICAL
4 hours, fast? What a sense of humor!

ALEX
Yet we see the coast, The journey seems quite short, why is it so long?

GEDESPOINA
Because of the very strong currents, we will pass between the continent and the island of (TBD). Our boat will have to fight against the current to advance towards the island. But everything will be fine, don't worry. We will move forward like a crab

ALEX
Are there accidents?

GEDESPOINA
No, my young friend. I take this ferry every week and I assure you it's very safe ...

CYNICAL
If you make sure it's safe, we should be reassured by this insurance!

GEDESPOINA
Your humor is caustic but it does not bother me.
It is necessary to reassure this young man who seems frightened and this beautiful tall lady who seems ... to control her fear.
Come on, let's settle down and talk to pass the time.

[[on Alex's cynicism]]

EXT. BACK OF THE CHANNEL BOAT - DAY # 2 #

CYNICAL
We will spend 4 hours in this nut shell and we should not worry

ALEX
Gedespoina takes it every week, do you think it's wrong?

CYNICAL
Come on Alex, do not be naive. She just wants to reassure you, that's her character. Some people can not help but see the glass half full, even when it is empty. GEDESPOINA will always see the world with pink glasses

ALEX
You mean we are at risk of an accident? Or maybe death?

Alex and CYNICAL move to the front of the boat. The camera follows them

[[on death]]

EXT. FRONT OF THE CHANNEL BOAT - DAY # 3 #

Alex and CYNICAL arrive at GEDESPOINA

CYNICAL
life is a disease that has a 100% chance of leading to death

ALEX
why are people dying?

CYNICAL
come on Alex, that's life

GEDESPOINA
Mourning can be difficult, however there is always hope for the living who ...

CYNICAL
no, there is none, 100% of the living die

ALEX
what is after death?

GEDESPOINA
officially, nobody came back to tell, however ...

CYNICAL
that's why it's hopeless

CYNICAL moves away from the back of the boat

[[disappearance]]

EXT. DRONE SIDE VIEW OF THE CHANNEL BOAT - DAY # 4 #

DARKHAIREDGIRL, Gedespoina and ALEX are at the bow, CYNICAL at the stern

EXT. FRONT OF THE CHANNEL BOAT - DAY # 5 #

Alex speaks with GEDESPOINA
DARKHAIREDGIRL goes away for a moment then comes back
ALEX goes to the bathroom and does not see CYNICAL

ALEX
the gentleman has disappeared! He is no longer on the boat

GEDESPOINA
Oh my God, he must have fallen into the water, or he has thrown himself into the water. I did not listen to him when he spoke of death, I could have, no I should have comforted him more. Captain! A man overboard !

EXT. BACK OF THE CHANNEL BOAT - DAY # 6 #

CAPTAIN
throw him a buoy, we are too heavy, if I stop the boat we will go right on the reefs

DARKHAIREDGIRL runs and while she attaches the buoy with a long rope

DARKHAIREDGIRL
Alex, always show it with your finger to assess where I throw the buoy

ALEX
I do not see it in the water!

GEDESPOINA
maybe he does not know how to swim, or he is stunned

ALEX
what are we doing ?

DARKHAIREDGIRL
Captain, it is not visible, alert other boats and the captaincy

Alex is crying, his hands are shaking,

[[shocked, honest]]

Gedespoina consoles him and pours a tear
DARKHAIREDGIRL looks away to look for a body

[[Suspicions]]

EXT. FRONT OF THE CHANNEL BOAT - DAY # 7 #

ALEX
what could have happened?

GEDESPOINA
If it was me and I fall into the water I would have immediately shouted

DARKHAIREDGIRL
with the sound of the motor and the speed of the currents, we do not hear

GEDESPOINA
you think ?

DARKHAIREDGIRL throws a paper into the water that moves away very quickly and flows with a swirl.

DARKHAIREDGIRL
I'm sure

ALEX
but how could he fall?

DARKHAIREDGIRL
accident

GEDESPOINA
In 10 years on this boat, I have never seen or heard of an accident like this. Maybe this pulley?

CAPTAIN
the pulleys were attached at the time of the departure of the boat

[[Starred with alex]]

EXT - BACK OF THE CHANNEL BOAT - DAY # 8 #

GEDESPOINA
I do not want to think about the worst, and if he had been murdered?

ALEX
It is true that the tall lady was not there for a moment and she did not react

DARKHAIREDGIRL silently arrives from behind

[[Explanation]]

DARKHAIREDGIRL
personally, I have no reason to kill him

ALEX
but where were you when you were absent?

DARKHAIREDGIRL
I went to the bathroom, far from your discussion

GEDESPOINA
why did you say "personally"? Would any of us have reasons to kill him? Or a person who is not on this boat? I did not know him.

ALEX
me neither

GEDESPOINA
he could not fall into the water alone. By the way, what is your name?

DARKHAIREDGIRL
No matter, remember, it was I who prepared the buoy and asked the captain to warn other ships. You judge me on the expression of my feelings or on my action? In this case, what about Alex?

ALEX
me ?

DARKHAIREDGIRL
Yes, you were the last to go in his direction, no?

Alex's tears are rising, the voice is breaking

ALEX
But I did not see him,

ALEX
and I went right back to warn you

GEDESPOINA
yes, yes it's true, I do not want to see the bad for anyone here. Come on, let's not oppose each other, it will not make him come back

ALEX
what to do now?

DARKHAIREDGIRL
the captain will warn the authorities and there will be a quick investigation

ALEX
How do you know ?

DARKHAIREDGIRL
logic

GEDESPOINA
That's right, I'm a diplomat and during studies, we also learn that. All the administrative procedures of the countries we deal with

ALEX
But why would the investigation be quick?

DARKHAIREDGIRL
Because nobody saw anything, it's an accident

GEDESPOINA
It's strange to see, or rather not see, an accident so quickly arrived and no way to clear that.

DARKHAIREDGIRL
In general, the body goes back up

ALEX
That's right, I saw that on TV

GEDESPOINA
What's a teevee? What are you talking about my young Alex?

ALEX
On ... whatever. The decomposition of the body produces gases and the body goes up

DARKHAIREDGIRL
Unless he is weighted by something

GEDESPOINA
Oh no, what a horror! Now I imagine this poor man at the bottom of the water swelling like a balloon and oscillating with the current, the rope stretched

ALEX
He who could not see the glass half full

DARKHAIREDGIRL
Beautiful epitaph. We're arriving
